## Overview

I designed this application for my wife's affiliate blogging website. It allowed her to use template tags to easily pull information from the [BandsInTown API](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/Bandsintown/PublicAPI/3.0.0). This was designed to work with the BandsInTown API v 2.0, which will be deprecated soon. As my wife no longer maintains that affiliate blog, I have since stopped maintaining this app, but it served its purpose quite well.

## Tech Stack

<a href="http://php.net/" target="\_blank"><i class="icon-php-alt" style="font-size:4em;"></i></a> PHP for the plugin that interacts with the BandsInTown API.
