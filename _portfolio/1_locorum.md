## Overview

A key aspect of any SEO campaign involves a dedicated approach to improve local search rankings. Many of the top factors [listed by Moz](https://moz.com/local-search-ranking-factors) that lead to a negative rating are with respect to the accuracy of a business' information on local listing sites. [Nebo Agency](http://www.neboagency.com/), an Atlanta based online marketing agency, was seeking a solution for automating the process of checking local listings on a series of local listing sites. With no solution readily available to agencies, I was asked to assist with the creation of an application that would aggregate search results, rank them, and provide links for the SEO team to make the necessary changes.
