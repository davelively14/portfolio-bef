# One and Done

I'm thrilled to say that after 854 consecutive days of [GitHub commits](https://github.com/davelively14), I'll be starting my first software engineering job at [SalesLoft](https://salesloft.com/). I'm sure I didn't do this the right way: after a full two years of teaching myself how to program and attending a bootcamp, I only applied to SalesLoft. But they were my far and away the company I wanted to work for.

Why? For one, I wanted to join an aggressive company with a start-up attitude. Second, they're SaaS - my top ranked industry. Third, I love their stack: Rails with AngularJS for most of the app, while using my favorites for new features: Elixir and React. Fourth, they sponsor (and now also [host](https://www.meetup.com/atlantaelixir/events/lhxvgpyxdbkb/)) the local Elixir Meetup, which afforded me the opportunity to meet the brilliant engineers I would get to work with.

It's been a fun 28 months, but I'm excited to have the opportunity to contribute to real world projects as a Support Engineer. A special shout out to my unofficial (i.e. he doesn't really know it yet) mentor, [Osa Gaius](https://www.linkedin.com/in/osagaius/). He runs the Elixir Meetups, helped me put together my [presentation]({{site.baseurl}}/speaking-at-a-meetup) for that Meetup, facilitated the introduction to [Ben Olive](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benolive/) at SalesLoft, and offered some fantastic career advice.
