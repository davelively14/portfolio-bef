## On other days...

Back in January of 2005, I was a shiny new 2nd LT. Following graduation, I had spent the previous fall learning how to lead tank and scout platoons in the classroom and the field. All my training was focused on how to best maneuver my troops in combat operations. I was by no means an expert, but I at least knew the basics. By January I was in Baghdad with my new unit, but due to some unsurprisingly poor personnel management by Uncle Sam, my unit had an overabundance of LTs, so with no scout platoons were available the leadership found a different place for me. I was assigned as an assistant intelligence officer - a job I had neither trained for nor had much exposure to. Twelve hours into the job, my boss - the senior intelligence officer for the unit - tasked me to brief the intelligence portion of the nightly battle update brief.

I'm not sure if the term imposter syndrome really applied in this case. After all, I really was an imposter. I was about to stand up and provide an intel brief for senior leaders of the squadron, all without having a real clue what I was about to do. The next 15 minutes was a bit of a blur, but the singular moment I'll always remember is when I pronounced HUMINT as "hum (like humming a line of music) int" and received a chorus of laughter. What I didn't learn in my 12 hours of prior training, was that HUMINT was an acronym for human intelligence (i.e. sources told us...). Apparently, to a bunch of senior Army officers, it was really funny to hear the butter bar talk about whole numbers quietly making music.

I learned two big lessons that day. First, always double check that you're pronouncing things the right way ([jason, jay-sawn, or J-S-O-N](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhVdWQWKRqM&feature=youtu.be)?). Second, you'll survive public speaking gaffs. I went on to be ranked the top officer in the unit, be afforded the honor to command two troops, function as the senior US commander for an area roughly the size of Deleware along the Iraqi/Syrian border, and successfully briefed Generals, foreign heads of state, and CONDELs (pronounced Kahn Dells, for those tracking at home - Congressional Delegations).

## On other fields...

So fast forward to October 2017. I had just completed [Flatfoot]({{site.baseurl}}/portfolio/1_flatfoot/), an app I built using a release candidate for the upcoming Phoenix 1.3. It was a significant departure from the MVC world of Phoenix 1.2 and I learned a lot about service-oriented design. I thought it would be an interesting topic of discussion for the Atlanta Elixir Meetup. Our organizer, Osa Gaius, agreed. I had a month to get my slides together.

There's no better way to learn a particular subject matter than to teach it. Not only are you able to better visualize and speak to what you did by having to explain what your project does, but you also identify gaps and your knowledge base and work to fill them. For this particular project, I initially struggled to explain the importance of what Phoenix 1.3 was doing. I knew it was decoupling quite a bit of the web app's functionality, and there was something about Domain Driven Design...but I felt like I wasn't quite explaining it well enough.

Enter Osa. A week before the meetup, Osa and I walked through my presentation and he really helped point me in the right direction. I learned more about service-oriented design and rebuilt my presentation to explain how Phoenix 1.3 implemented that design paradigm. Now confident in my content, I practiced my presentation a few dozen times.

## Fruits of victory...

I think I was more nervous preparing and practicing the presentation than when I actually gave it. I credit three factors in overcoming the imposter syndrome:
1. I was confident that my content was correct and clear.
2. I practiced giving it over and over. Some people record themselves or do it in front of friends and/or family. While those methods can help you improve your techniques, to overcome the imposter syndrome it's more important to have confidence in your knowledge of the material.
3. I lowered the stakes in my head by reminding myself that no matter how bad I screwed up, I knew I could recover.

Fortunately, this presentation was better received than my intel brief was back in 2005. Having given this presentation, I have a better mastery of the material I have studied over the past couple years. But perhaps even more importantly, I have full confidence than I can engage in technical conversations with mid-level to senior developers.
