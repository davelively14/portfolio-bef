## Upon other fields...

Back in January, 2005, I was a shiny new 2nd LT. I had spent the previous fall learning how to lead tank and scout platoons in the classroom and the field. All my training was focused on how to best maneuver my troops in combat operations. I was by no means an expert, but I at least knew the basics. By January I was in Baghdad with my new unit, but due to an over abundance of LTs no scout platoons were available yet. Instead, I was assigned as an assistant intelligence officer. Twelve hours into the job, my boss - the senior intelligence officer for the unit - tasked me to brief the nightly battle update brief.

I'm not sure if the term imposter syndrome really applied in this case. After all, I really was an imposter. I was about to stand up and provide an intel brief for senior leaders of the squadron, all without having a real clue what I was about to do. The next 15 minutes was a bit of a blur, but the singular moment I'll always remember is when I pronounced HUMINT as "hum (like humming a line of music) int" and received a chorus of laughter. What I didn't learn in my 12 hours of prior training, was that HUMINT was an acronym for human intelligence (i.e. sources told us...). Apparently, to a bunch of senior Army officers, it was really funny to hear the butter bar talk about whole numbers quietly making music.

I learned two big lessons that day. First, always double check that you're pronouncing things the right way ([jason, jay-sawn, or J-S-O-N](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhVdWQWKRqM&feature=youtu.be)?). Second, you'll survive public speaking gaffs. I went on to be ranked the top officer in the unit, be afforded the honor to command two troops, was the senior US commander for an area roughly the size of Deleware along the Iraqi/Syrian border, and successfully briefed Generals, foreign heads of state, and CONDELs (pronounced Kahn Dells, for those tracking at home - Congressional Delegations).

## On other days...

So fast forward to October 2017. I had just completed [Flatfoot]({{site.baseurl}}/portfolio/1_flatfoot/), an app I built using a release candidate for the upcoming Phoenix 1.3. It was a significant departure from the MVC world of Phoenix 1.2 and I learned a lot about service-oriented design. I thought it would be an interesting topic of discussion for the Atlanta Elixir Meetup. Our organizer, Osa Gaius, agreed. I had a month to get my slides together.

...To be continued...
